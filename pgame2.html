                <h1>Desktopper</h1>      
                <p>Desktopper was my second game I made with Unity. 
                    It was made <strong>very</strong> close to the deadline, which is why it feels and is very incomplete. 
                    When I had the idea I was thinking to make more of a story with it, where there’s like a virus taking over the desktop of the game and that you had to beat the minigames to kill the virus. 
                    In short I got as far as having some simple minigames with basic graphics and basic functionality.</p>

                <h2>Minigames</h2>
                <p>These minigames were the first and easiest games I could think of to make for this project. 
                    These games being: PixelIvaders (space invaders), FlappyPixel (flappy bird), and PixelFormer (a very simple platformer), all of which can be seen below. 
                    As you can tell by the elegant naming scheme, they all include the word ‘pixel’ in them, this is because I didn’t actually want to do much with the graphics because of the aforementioned time crunch I was in at the time.
